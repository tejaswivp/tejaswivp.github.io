## 🚀 About Me

[cite_start]I am a **Master’s student in Electrical and Computer Engineering** at **Purdue University** (Expected May 2027)[cite: 92], specializing in **Deep Learning**, **Computer Vision**, and **Generative AI**.

My work lies at the intersection of **scientific research** and **scalable engineering**. I build systems that bridge biological plausibility (like human visual foraging) with practical AI applications (like autonomous cloud agents and document intelligence).

## 🛠️ Featured Engineering Projects

### 📄 [Agentic AI PDF Editor](https://pdf-form-editor-gilt.vercel.app/)
*> An intelligent, agentic document processing platform.*

I engineered a full-stack AI platform that uses Computer Vision and LLMs to interactively edit and fill PDF forms via natural language.
- **The Tech:** Built with **React (Konva/Framer Motion)** frontend and **FastAPI** backend.
- **Agentic AI:** Integrated **Google Gemini 2.5** to power a conversational agent that executes commands (e.g., *"Set the date to today and clear the signature"*).
- **Computer Vision:** Utilized **YOLO (FFDNet)** and **Tesseract OCR** for intelligent layout analysis and field detection.

### ☁️ Autonomous Incident Response Agent
[cite_start]*> Serverless AWS Architecture for IT Triage.* [cite: 133, 145]

Engineered a serverless autonomous agent that processes unstructured natural language tickets and executes remediation actions.
- **Stack:** **AWS Lambda**, **Amazon Bedrock (Claude 3 Haiku)**, Python.
- **Innovation:** Implemented a constrained decoding framework to enforce strict JSON output schemas, ensuring deterministic execution from stochastic LLM outputs.
- **Impact:** Automates IT triage by chaining LLM reasoning with deterministic Python logic.

## 🔬 Featured Research

### 👁️ [Foraging with the Eyes (Gaze Analysis)](https://github.com/tejaswivp/gaze-analysis)
[cite_start]*Research at SENAI Lab, IIT Madras* [cite: 95, 96]
- **Discovery:** Proved that human visual search follows **Lévy Walk statistics**, optimizing the path taken while looking at images.
- **Deep Learning:** Developed a **MobileNetV2-based U-Net** for fixation prediction.
- **Impact:** Created one of the world’s largest human eye gaze datasets (**4M+ datapoints**) and achieved **>90% Pearson correlation** with ground truth.

### 🧠 [Adaptive Cognitive Architecture for LLMs](https://github.com/tejaswivp/fyp)
[cite_start]*Generative AI Research* [cite: 97]
- **Innovation:** Engineered an adaptive system with dynamic modular AI routing and self-reflective feedback.
- **Efficiency:** Reallocates computation dynamically to minimize "surprise," achieving a **10-15% reduction in FLOPs** compared to static models and reducing overhead by 50-100ms.

### 📈 [Algorithmic ETF Trading System](https://github.com/tejaswivp/ETF-analysis-ml)
[cite_start]*Financial Machine Learning* [cite: 98]
- **Strategy:** A LightGBM/XGBoost-based system with volatility filters and trend-aware exits.
- **Results:** Achieved a **CAGR of 15.3%** and a **Sharpe Ratio of 0.87** (benchmarked against SPY/QQQ).
